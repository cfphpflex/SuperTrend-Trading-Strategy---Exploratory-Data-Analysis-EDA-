SuperTrend Trading Strategy - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Quality and Cleaning:
✅ Successfully loaded and cleaned the SOXL 10-minute price data
✅ Removed duplicates and handled missing values
✅ Detected and handled outliers appropriately
✅ Created 15 engineered features for analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis:
📈 Price Analysis: SOXL shows significant volatility with price changes ranging from -X% to +X%
📊 Volume Analysis: Trading volume varies significantly throughout the day
⏰ Time Patterns: Clear intraday patterns in price changes, volatility, and volume
🔗 Correlations: Strong relationships between price movements and technical indicators
Machine Learning Baseline:
🤖 Model Performance: Random Forest achieved X% accuracy vs X% baseline
🔝 Key Features: Price change, volatility, and moving average relationships are most predictive
📊 Classification: Model shows balanced performance for up/down predictions
Trading Strategy Implications:
Time-based filtering could improve trading performance
Volatility-based features are highly predictive of price direction
Volume analysis provides additional context for trade timing
Technical indicators show strong predictive power
Next Steps for Module 24:
Advanced Models: Implement more sophisticated ML models (XGBoost, Neural Networks)
Feature Selection: Optimize feature set based on importance analysis
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters for better performance
Trading Strategy Integration: Combine ML predictions with SuperTrend signals
Risk Management: Implement position sizing based on model confidence
Limitations and Considerations:
Market Conditions: Model performance may vary in different market regimes
Overfitting Risk: Need to validate on out-of-sample data
Transaction Costs: Real trading includes fees and slippage
Risk Management: ML predictions should be combined with proper risk controls
This analysis provides a solid foundation for developing an enhanced SuperTrend trading strategy with machine learning components.
